# Broader points

## One-page summary
Use 200 years of data from England and Wales. 

Large, contiguous plots of land around the city are associated with:

- stronger specialization
- fast population growth earlier, decline later

## Broader comments
Economies of scale, scope and density are most interesting in economics.

Big shifts in sectoral specialization, population, productivity and economic geography likely related.

Spatial macroeconomics is promising not only for historical development.

### But 
Much depends on relative weights of other dimensions; need to know more.

Very few spatial data is truly raster; often based on vectoral data; can be misleading.

## Example: WorldPop raster

## This is a problem for all top-down datasets

# One point about theory
## One point about theory
This is a reversal of fortune story. These stories are challenging for neoclassical economics for two reasons:

1. contradict perfect foresight
2. contradict free disposal

## Why are some cities bad that used to be good?
1. myopia or externalities
2. adjustment costs, irreversbilities, non-convexities
