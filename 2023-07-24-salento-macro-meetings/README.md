## One-slide summary
1. Aggregate labor share has declined in the US and other developed countries. But firm-level labor share is increasing.
2. Model with risk-averse firm owners: quantity and price of firm-specific risk drives labor share.
    - Predicts within-firm increases and reallocation towards low-labor-share firms.
4. Additional predictions confirmed in Compustat data: 
    - Risky firms have lower labor share.
    - Firms with foreign equity are more responsive to risk.

## Outline
1. Intuition for the main mechanism
2. Are public firms representative of the economy?
3. Can we replicate the results in Hungary?

## Risk-adjusted profit maximization
$$
\max_L \text E[AF(K,L) - wL]
$$
vs
$$
\max_L \text E[\Lambda [AF(K,L) - wL]]
$$

# Intuition
## Intuition
Firm is a *leveraged* portfolio with a risky asset $Q$ and a safe liability $L$.

Key assumption: labor is less risky than capital.

Optimal leverage depends on risk-return tradeoff: higher risk means lower leverage.

## Glossary

### labor
inputs decided before uncertainty is resolved

### labor share
leverage ratio

### low-labor-share firm
high excess-return portfolio

# Are public firms representative of the economy?

## Volatility trends differ for public and private firms (Comin and Philippon 2006 vs Davis et al 2007)
![Davis et al 2007 (Figure 2.5)](fig/fig2-5.pdf)

# Can we replicate the results in Hungary?
## Data from Hungary
Universe of corporations, 1989-2019: 870k businesses, of which 99% are private.

Labor share: personnel costs / value added (as in paper)

Firm beta: 2-year growth rate of log sales on log aggregate growth (unlike in paper)


## Higher beta firms have lower labor share
| Beta portfolio | Mean labor share     |
-----------------|-----------|
| 0                        | 0.619     |
| 1                        | 0.589     |
| 2                        | 0.523     |
| 3                        | 0.457     |
| 4                        | 0.456     |

## Bigger firms have lower labor share
| Size portfolio | Mean labor share   |
|----------------|--------|
| 0              | 0.785  |
| 1              | 0.725  |
| 2              | 0.665  |
| 3              | 0.582  |
| 4              | 0.508  |


## Except for largest firms, labor share is driven by size, not beta
| Beta | Size 0 | Size 1 | Size 2 | Size 3 | Size 4 | 
|--------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 0                        | 0.772            | 0.702            | 0.640            | 0.527            | 0.621            |
| 1                        | 0.786            | 0.732            | 0.664            | 0.596            | 0.587            |
| 2                        | 0.788            | 0.741            | 0.680            | 0.594            | 0.519            |
| 3                        | 0.775            | 0.723            | 0.663            | 0.574            | 0.449            |
| 4                        | 0.787            | 0.720            | 0.661            | 0.580            | 0.441            |

# Conclusion
## Conclusion
Great to bring in asset pricing and portfolio choice in production problems.

Helps reinterpret real metrics (markup, labor share) as financial (risk premium, leverage).

But: finance and risk of private firms very different from those of public firms.

## Smaller points
What if markets are incomplete? $\Lambda_{it}$ rather than $\Lambda_t$
