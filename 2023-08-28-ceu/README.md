### Evaluations

On ERC Starting Grant panel 2020 and 2022. Expert reviewer for several proposals in other years.

## Do
1. Spend a lot of time preparing the proposal.
2. Explain research plan.
3. Make it coherent.

## Spend a lot of time preparing the proposal
If 150 hours can increase your chances by 10pp, your hourly wage is 1000 EUR.

The best use of your time.

## Explain research plan
Focus on crafting an exciting research plan.

Explain *what* you will do and *how*. Useful for you and makes the proposal credible.

Lot of work before funding, but see #1.

## Make it coherent
Better one big question than several loosely related projects.

In economics, 4-5 studies are promised. Best to have a common theme and an arc.

## Don't
1. Ignore related literature.
2. Hide your related work.
3. Strategize too much.

## Don't ignore related literature
Panel members come from different fields. If there is relevant connection, cite it.

## Don't hide your related work
Be transparent about your own related work. If you have a paper, cite it.

Beware: reviewers will see your proposal 5-8 months after submission.

## Don't strategize too much
Don't try to guess what the panel wants. It is a diverse group.

Don't spend time guessing who will be on the panel. Can even be counterproductive.

# Good luck!
