 The dependent variable is the log monthly earning of the worker in the given year.
 All specifications control for occupation-year and firm-year fixed effects, 
 indicators for gender and schooling and a quadratic function of worker age.
 In column 1, observations are weighted by $1/n_{fot}$, the inverse of the number of workes in a firm-occupation-year cell.
 In column 4, we also control for, but do not report, quartiles of total (as opposed to occupation-specific) import per worker.
 Standard errors, clustered by firm, are reported in parantheses.
 Coefficients significantly different from zero at 1, 5 and 10 percent are marked by ***, ** and *, respectively.
