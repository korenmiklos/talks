"Dependent variable: log output per machine.  
Sample: machine-months for five types of loom. Estimation: OLS.
The average residual wage was measured by regressing individual log annual earnings (based on payment 
by results) in 1989 on age, age squared and type of machine fixed effects, and averaging the residual for 
workers employed at the given type of machine in the given month. Output is measured in million pics/month.
Standard errors (in parentheses) are calculated from a 200-repetition bootstrap. Coefficients significantly different 
from zero at 1, 5 and 10 percent are marked by ***, ** and *, respectively. "
