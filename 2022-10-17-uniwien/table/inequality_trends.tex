\item \footnotesize Notes: Table displays the wage gap between various groups of workers over time. The second column shows the wage difference (in log points) associated with a high-school degree (relative to primary school and vocational school), controlling worker gender, age and occupation. The third column shows the log point difference between the 90th and 10th percentile of the within-occupation wage distribution. The minimum wage has been raised by 96 percent between 2000 and 2002, significantly reducing both wage gaps.
