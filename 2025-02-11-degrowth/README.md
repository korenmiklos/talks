# A summary of the degrowth argument
1. An ever-growing economy leads to ever-growing consumption of resources and ever-growing pollution.
2. Hitting planetary boundaries will lead to catastrophic consequences.
3. Therefore, we need to stop/slow economic growth, focus on well-being instead.


# Points of agreement

1. Markets cannot solve everything
2. Difficulty of the problem is unprecedented (global threat, threshold effects)
3. Little evidence of **decoupling** so far
4. Need for radical changes


# Can we decouple economic growth from increasing harm?

# The dual decoupling
Past data shows that economic growth is strongly correlated with both pollution and well-being.

In the degrowth argument,

### Pollution
The future will be like the past.

\pause
### Well-being
This time it's different.

# A case of a global, catastrophic event

## The Covid pandemic
Frequent travel and interaction of people increase the risk of infection.

\pause
Policy responses:

1. Stay at home
\pause
2. Wear a mask
\pause
3. Get tested
\pause
4. Get vaccinated

# Conclusion

Stop bashing economic growth.

Focus on harm reduction.
