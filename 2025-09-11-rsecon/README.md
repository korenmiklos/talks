## The Editor Says You Have One Week

- Journal editor: "substantial revision invited"
- Reviewers liked Figure 1 (life expectancy vs GDP per capita)
- Concern about health data source
- You need to:
  - Address reviewer concerns
  - Redo analysis with new data
  - Recreate Figure 1
  - Submit within one week

## But Your Submission is Months Old

- Research submitted months ago
- Team has been improving data cleaning since then
- Different statistical methods now
- **First question**: How did I actually produce Figure 1?

## Research Results are Functions

$$\text{Figure 1} = f(\text{code}, \text{data})$$

- Results depend on both algorithms and data
- Code under version control (Git) -> Yes
- Tagged commit at submission -> Yes
- **But what about the data?**

## Data is Also a Function

$$\text{data}_1 = f(\text{code}_2, \text{data}_2)$$

- Data produced by wrangling/cleaning steps
- Which countries dropped?
- What transformations applied?
- Feature engineering details?
- **Chain of data provenance**

## Real-World Data Pipelines

- Multiple datasets merged
- Many cleaning steps  
- Different versions coexisting
- Green = using latest version
- Red/yellow = outdated dependencies
- Complex dependency graph

## The Data Provenance Problem

### Why it's complex:
1. **Frequent changes**: Code and data both evolve
2. **Complex pipelines**: Many steps, multiple datasets
3. **Tool heterogeneity**: Python, R, SQL, DuckDB all in one project

## Team Dynamics Make it Worse

- Master/PhD students graduate and leave
- Different team members use different tools
- **Every meeting starts with**:
  - "Who knows how to reproduce this?"
  - "Who has the data?"
  - "That person already left..."

## Existing Solutions

### Version Control (Git)
- Great for code
- Not suitable for large binary data

### Data Version Control (DVC)
- Similar spirit to BEAD
- More complex than needed
- [dvc.org](https://dvc.org)

### Orchestration Tools
- Apache Airflow (Python) - [airflow.apache.org](https://airflow.apache.org)
- dbt (SQL) - [getdbt.com](https://www.getdbt.com)
- KNIME (no-code) - [knime.com](https://knime.com)
- Too complex for heterogeneous teams

## Enter BEAD

**A command-line tool that ensures your output is a function of your input**

- Much simpler than alternatives
- Language agnostic
- Works with heterogeneous teams
- Different experience levels
- Different operating systems

## What BEAD Does NOT Do

### Not a code runner
- You run your own code
- Python, R, Stata, SQL - doesn't matter

### Not a file delivery system
- File system stores your files
- You copy/move files yourself

### Only requirement:
- Works with flat files on file system
- Files not too big (20GB works fine)

## What BEAD Enforces

### Input data is immutable
- Cannot modify raw data
- Forces good practices
- Preserves data lineage

## Core BEAD Concepts

### The BEAD
- Self-contained computational unit
- Contains code, data, results
- Packaged as ZIP file
- Remembers exact provenance

### Simple Commands
```bash
bead new my-analysis
bead input add source-data
bead save results
```

## Demo Time

Christian will now demonstrate BEAD in action...

## How BEAD Solves Our Problems

| Problem | BEAD Solution |
|---------|---------------|
| "What data did we use?" | Every bead remembers exact version |
| "It worked on my machine" | Exact same setup for everyone |
| "That person left" | Work stays reproducible |
| Team uses different tools | Language agnostic |
| Complex pipelines | Chain beads together |

## Real Research Example

- Multiple datasets connected
- Many cleaning steps
- Green = using latest data version
- Some steps outdated
- BEAD tracks entire dependency graph

## BEAD in Practice

### Step 1: Create workspace
```bash
bead new health-analysis
```

### Step 2: Load inputs
```bash
bead input add wdi-data
bead input add health-metrics
```

### Step 3: Run analysis
```bash
python clean_data.py
R --file=analyze.R
```

### Step 4: Save snapshot
```bash
bead save figure1-v2
```

## Why BEAD is Different

- **Simple**: 4 commands to learn
- **Universal**: Any language, any tool
- **Portable**: Just ZIP files
- **Secure**: Data stays on your servers
- **Transparent**: Open source, no vendor lock-in

## For Research Software Engineers

- Minimal learning curve for researchers
- No infrastructure requirements
- Works with existing workflows
- Complements version control
- Enables true reproducibility

## Get Started

### Installation
```bash
pip install bead
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Data provenance is hard** - especially with changing teams
2. **Existing tools too complex** - for heterogeneous research teams  
3. **BEAD keeps it simple** - focuses on one thing well
4. **Reproducibility becomes automatic** - not an afterthought
