= Summary =
== Motivation ==
- Firms differ greatly in productivity. Understanding the sources of this dispersion is important for aggregate productivity, as well as inequality across firms and workers.
- Two robust facts about productivity differences:
  1. Better manageed firms are more productive.
  2. Firms in dense agglomerations are more productive.

== Questions ==
- What are the mechanisms? 
- Can policy use them to improve aggretage outcomes?
- What are the equilibrium effects?
- Quantitative measurement?

== Contribution ==
- I propose a class of models

== Five studies ==
=== Alignment ===
1. An alignment model of managers
2. Estimating a wage equation with multi-dimensional latent heterogeneity
=== Proximity ===
3. Disruption in business travel and the international activity of firms
4. The spatial span of control of multi-unit firms
5. Where do managers spend their time?

= Alignment =
== The alignment model of managers ==
There are $M$ exogenous market segments, each with a Cobb--Douglas production function:
\[
Y_{ij} = \sum_{m=1}^M 
  p_{m} a_{im} k_{jm} 
    \equiv \mathbf a_i'\mathbf P \mathbf k_j
    = \norm {\mathbf a_i}\norm{\mathbf P \mathbf k_j} \cos \theta_{ij}
\]
with $p_{m}=P_{m}^{1/(\nu+\alpha)}$, $a_{im}=A_{im}^{\nu/(\nu+\alpha)}$, $k_{jm} = K_{jm}^{\alpha/(\nu+\alpha)}$. 
Productivity is higher with
  - more ''skilled'' managers: $\norm {\mathbf a_i}$ high
  - more ''aligned'' managers: angle $\theta_{ij}$ low

== Why $m>1$? ==
- Skills are multi-dimensional.
- Managers are not perfectly sorted: CEO pay only partly explained by firm size.
- Not all firms adopt good management practices.
- Manager-firm assignment exhibits specific complementarities.
  - Market-specific trade knowledge (export, import) is persistent across firm assignments of managers.
  - Firms with foreign managers are more likely to export (even conditional on foreign ownership).

== Contributions ==
- Tractable general equilibrium model of how managers contribute to productivity.
  - Counterfactuals account for equilibrium feedback.
- Study how trade, FDI and immigration liberalization affect manager assignment, aggregate producticity and the firm size distribution.
  - Strong complementarities between policies.
- Estimates for 25 years of European integration.
