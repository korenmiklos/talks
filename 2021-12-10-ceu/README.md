# When time really matters
## When time really matters
- November 2019: outbreak in Wuhan
- December 27, 2019: new coronarivurs
- December 31, 2019: WHO informed
- January 30, 2020: WHO declares "public health emergency"
- March 11, 2020: WHO declares pandemic
- by March 31, 2020: most countries adopted strict social distancing measures

## Typical statistics publication calendar (BLS.gov)
![](exhibit/fig/bls-march-2020.png)

## Time-sensitive questions
- How does the virus spread?
- How many ventilators, PPEs, nurses etc. will we need? By when?
- What (non-pharmaceutical) interventions are effective against it?
- Which of these are most cost effective?
- What can policy do to mitigate the costs?
- (in addition to genome sequencing, drug and vaccine development, clinical research)



# The response of open science
## The response of open science
- Government, academia and industry came together quickly and effectively. (But: pressing issues remain.)
- Troves of data shared.
- Research results published fast.
    - 83 issues of *Covid Economics*, about 500 papers published.

### Is this the future of policy analysis?

## About 250,000 Covid-related articles

## Timely data collection
How to avoid the 2-3-month lag of official statistical releases? (Plus several months of peer review.)

Reuse existing data collected during "normal course of business":

- administrative
- private

## Bad examples with data

# Benefits
## Speed
## Universal coverage

# Concerns
## Statistics
- Sampling
- representativity
	- only for small random samples

## Economics / system modeling
- Lucas critique
- relative to SIR model of pandemic
- nonlinear responses

## Peaks of pandemic are notoriously hard to forecast (Chowell 2017)

## Politics
- incentives to hide/share information
	- governments
	- corporations

# The COVID shock

## Visits to retail and recreation places collapsed

## Many workplaces are shuttered 
![Data from Hungarian cell phone users (Google Mobility Report 2020)](exhibit/fig/gmr-work.pdf){width=100%}

## People are staying at home

## Which jobs are most affected?
Important for economic subsidy, vaccination programs.

[The most communication intensive sectors](https://www.datawrapper.de/_/NNmIa/)

## Many occupations rely heavily on face-to-face communication
!["Teamwork" refers to face-to-face communication with coworkers, "Customer contact" with customers (Koren and Pető 2020, based on U.S. data)](exhibit/fig/koren-peto-3.pdf){ height=65% }

## Face-to-face intensive industries have contracted the most
![Employment change in March 2020 against compound measure of social-distancing cost (Koren and Pető 2020, based on U.S. data)](exhibit/fig/koren-peto-5.pdf){height=70%}

## Job losses explained by fewer customer visits *and* communication intensity

## Tax-equivalent losses are huge

# The year after

## The year after
What will be the long-run consequences? To speculate, we use

* The 2017 CEU-MTA Business Relations Survey.
* A mini survey of 2020 CEU MBA students.

## The CEU-MTA Business Relations Survey
CEU and MTA asked 1,200 Hungarian, Slovakian and Romanian manufacturing firms about relationships with their key buyers and suppliers.

## Meetings are important for joint innovation
![A third of firms collaborated with their key customer in order to improve their product (Békés, Koren, Muraközy and Telegdy 2019)](exhibit/fig/supplier-start.pdf)

## This collaboration remained after start
![A quarter of firms collaborated with their key customer in order to improve their product (Békés, Koren, Muraközy and Telegdy 2019)](exhibit/fig/supplier-recent.pdf)

## Major business changes are expected
![](exhibit/fig/scenarios.png)

## Most meetings are with coworkers and clients
![](exhibit/fig/meet.png)

## Lack of new business opportunities is strongest risk
![](exhibit/fig/risks.png)

## Why are face-to-face meetings important for you work?

> "I work as a sales professional, where face-to-face interactions are key to build trustful relationships with my customers."
>
> "Face-to-face meetings ensure better quality of transferring strategic messages."
>
> "Non-verbal communication counts at least 30% of the total messages during meetings."
>
> "To build strong, lasting relationships."

## Can videoconferencing tools substitute for face-to-face meetings in your work?

> “We tried several times videoconferencing with customers, but not successfully. I doubt that we can switch to videoconferencing completely.”
> 
> “Lack of client and staff interaction reduces quality of service “
>
> “They can, up to certain level.”
>
> “Yes, we already moved to video conferencing, no loss in productivity”

# Conclusion
## Conclusion
* Face-to-face interaction is a key aspect of many jobs.
* In internal teamwork, working from home is a good alternative. But not for customer contact.
* Retail services suffer the most, in proportion to our predictions.
