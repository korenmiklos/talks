= Four facts =
== 1. Global exposure differs across firms, even conditional on size ==
1. Export shares vary widely, mostly independently of size. (next slide, Kee and Krishna 2008)
2. Size is a minor determinant of becoming an exporter. (Armenter and Koren 2015: pseudo-$R^2=0.05$)
3. Size is a minor determinant of importing intermediate inputs. (Halpern, Koren and Szeidl 2015)

\longfigure{export_share_by_owner}{Variation not fully explained by foreign ownership\\ (Hungary, manufacturing, 2003)}

== 2. Measures of global exposure are correlated ==
1. Firms with ''anything'' foreign are more likely to export (next slide, Bernard, Jensen and Schott 2009)
2. Foreign ''owned'' firms import more intermediate inputs (Halpern, Koren and Szeidl 2015) and machines (Halpern, Hornok, Koren and Szeidl 2019)
3. Exports and capital imports increase after foreign ''manager'' takes over firm (Koren and Telegdy 2019)

== 3. Firms enter new markets small ==
1. New exporters grow gradually (next slide from Ruhl and Willis 2017)
2. Young firms grow gradually (Arkolakis, Papageorgiou and Timoshenko 2018)

== 4. Managers earn high wages, especially at large firms ==
1. CEOs earn ''high'' wages, especially at large firms (next slide from Frydman and Saks 2010)
2. Managers with special experience earn more (Bertrand and Schoar 2003, Mion and Opromolla 2014)

= Model =

== Production function ==
Firm $j$, market $i$
\[
Q_{ij}=A_j K_{ij}^\alpha L_{ij}^{1-\alpha}\text{ with } i=H,F
\]
...
in contrast to
\[
\sum_iQ_{ij} = A_jK_j^\alpha L_j^{1-\alpha}
\]
...
Firm characterized by $(A_j, K_{Hj}, K_{Fj})$

== Market access skills ==
Manager $m$, market $i$
\[
\kappa_{im}p_i \text{ with }\kappa_{im} \in (0,1)
\]
...
Manager characterized by $(\kappa_{Hm}, \kappa_{Fm})$

== Net revenue per market ==
\[
\kappa_{im}p_i A_j K_{ij}^{\alpha} L_{ij}^{1-\alpha} - w L_{ij}
\]
Labor frictionlessly hired,
\[
R_{ijm} =  \left(\frac {1-\alpha} {w}\right)^{1/\alpha-1} 
{(\kappa_{im}p_i)^{1/\alpha}\strut} {A_j^{1/\alpha} K_{ij}\strut}
\]
...
\[
R_{ijm} = \tilde \kappa_{im} \tilde K_{ij}
\]

== Assignment ==
Firms hire managers in frictionless, competitive markets. Optimal manager maximizes net revenue minus her wage,
\[
\max_m \alpha\sum_i R_{ijm} - \nu_m =  \max_m \alpha\sum_i \tilde\kappa_{im}\tilde K_{ij} - \nu_m,
\]

== Equilibrium ==
Given fixed distributions over $(A_j, K_{Hj}, K_{Fj})$ and $(\kappa_{Hm}, \kappa_{Fm})$ (with $\#j = \#m$), determine
- firm-manager assignment: $\mu(j,m)$
- manager wages: $\nu_m$
- firm profits: $\pi_j$
- revenue per market: $R_{ijm}$

== Key ingredients ==
1. Diminishing returns within each market
2. Inelastic supply of manager skills
3. Complementarity of manager skills with firm capital


== Optimal transport ==
Equilibrium assingment is equivalent to following optimal transport problem (Galichon 2016)
\[
\int_{j,m}\mu(j,m) (\tilde {\mathbf K}_j - \tilde{\mathbf\kappa}_m)^2 djdm \to \min
\]
s.t.
\[
\int_j \mu(j,m) dj = \mu(j)
\]
\[
\int_m \mu(j,m) dm = \mu(m)
\]
...
Focus on discrete manager types, continuous firm types.

= Predictions =
== Cross sectional predictions ==
1. Conditional on $R_{j}$, there is heterogeneity in $R_{Fj}/R_{Dj}$.
2. Managers at larger firms earn more.
3. Manager wages convex in $\mathbf K$.
4. Conditional on $R_{Dj}$, managers at high $R_{Fj}$ firms earn more.

== Export heterogeneity ==
\[
\text{Var}\ln R_{ij} =
	\text{Var}\ln \tilde \kappa_{im} +
	\text{Var}\ln \tilde K_{jm} +
	2\text{Cov}(\ln \tilde \kappa_{im},
				\ln \tilde K_{jm})
\]
- additional heterogeneity in managers: $\text{Var}\ln \tilde \kappa_{im}>0$
- complementarity of managers and firms: $2\text{Cov}(\ln \tilde \kappa_{im},\ln \tilde K_{jm})>0$

= Comparative statics =
== Supply shock ==

== Trade liberalization ==
Export markets become liberalized ($p_F$ increases).
1. Managers with export skills earn more.
2. Net entry into exporting is zero (by assumption).
3. Export-skilled managers move from low export-intensity firms to high export-intensity firms. (magnifying export heterogeneity)

= Measurement =
== (Potential) Data ==
* Panel of all Hungarian firms, 1992--2017.
* Panel of all CEOs active in Hungary, 1992--2017.
* Export and domestic revenue. (Also by destination country, 1992--2003.)
* CEO wages?

== Measurement ==
We have data on
\[
R_{ijm} = \tilde\kappa_{im} \tilde K_{ij}
\]
and
\[
\sum_i K_{ij}.
\]
...
How to recover $\tilde\kappa_{im}$ and $\tilde K_{ij}$?

== Option 1 ==
Treat both as fixed effects (Abowd, Kramarz and Margolis 1999).
\[
\ln R_{ijm} = \ln\tilde\kappa_{im} + \ln\tilde K_{ij}
\]
Estimate separate firm- and manager-effects for each market.
...
But
1. $\tilde\kappa_{im}$ changes over time (prices)
2. $\tilde K_{i}$ may change over time (capital accumulation)

== Option 2 ==
Treat $\tilde\kappa_{im}$ as parameter (few manager types), $\tilde K_{ij}$ as error term.
...
After arrival of foreign manager,
\[
\Delta \ln R_{Fjm} = \ln \frac{\tilde\kappa_{FF}}{\tilde\kappa_{FD}}  + \ln \tilde K_{Fj}.
\]
Diff-in-diff in Koren and Telegdy (2019) consistent with $\tilde\kappa_{FF} \gg \tilde\kappa_{FD}$ and $\tilde\kappa_{DF} > \tilde\kappa_{DD}$.
...
Instrument manager assignment with supply shocks (EU accession 2004, 2007, cohort effects).

== Option 3 ==
Exploit multi-dimensionality of problem. Assignment based on
\[
\sum_i R_{ijm},
\]
not $R_{ijm}$. 
...
Shocks affecting $R_{ijm}$ can be used to estimate revenue function in all markets $\neq i$.

= Next steps =
== Next steps ==
1. Think more about measurement.
2. Having more fun with the model: Firms can change $K$ with some adjustment cost. Could explain sluggish export market dynamics.
3. Think about zeros. But not fixed costs.
